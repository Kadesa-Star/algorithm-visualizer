THE ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
---------------------------

Problem Statement
-----------------
Understanding algorithms can be challenging, especially for visual learners. 
Traditional methods, such as reading code or static diagrams, often fail to convey the dynamic nature of these processes. 
This project solves that problem by providing an intuitive, visual tool for learning algorithms in an engaging and interactive way.

Solution
--------
The Algorithm Visualizer will provide an interactive platform where users can:

* Select and visualize different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, QuickSort).
* See animations of data being processed step-by-step.
* Compare algorithm performance visually, with metrics like time complexity highlighted.
* (Optional) View pseudocode alongside visualizations for deeper understanding.

Technologies
-------------
___________
This project will leverage the following technologies:
Frontend:
- React for building dynamic and interactive components.
- CSS for styling and animations to enhance the visual appeal.
- HTML for structuring the web pages and implementing a responsive layou
